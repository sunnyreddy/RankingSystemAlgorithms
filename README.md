# Description
In this project we are going to predict the final standing of teams in EPL 2019-2020. 
Due to Covid19 many matches have postponed so using the current standings and matches data I am going to predict the remaining game outcomes and make a final standings table of teams. Currently 216 matches had been played by various teams. So, from the remaining 92 matches I am going to predict the outcomes through which I will find the final Standings.

# Steps to Run Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open project in IntelIJ
3. Run the main method in RankingSystem.java in main/java/edu/neu/coe to get the final standings in output
4. Run test classes to check if classes are working properly
